## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   Flexbox
-   JS

### What I learned

This was a fun refesher on Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. I think it was nice to reinforce some of the basics. I enjoyed crating the gradient for the cta hover state and using box shadow instead of border.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.form-button:hover {
	background: linear-gradient(
		to right,
		hsl(4, 100%, 67%),
		hsl(21, 100%, 67%)
	);
	box-shadow: 2px 10px 30px hsl(4, 100%, 67%, 0.4);
	cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm sure I could use more semantic html tags here. It's easy to just use plain divs, but that's something I want to move away from. I think i want to use more CSS conventions like BEM and perhaps other CSS extention languages.

### Useful resources

-   [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This was useful whenever I forgot some selector syntax or styling attribute.
